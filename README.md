# Portfolio
My personal website
I am making the website to practice the HTML and CSS I have learned.
As of Aug 3rd, 2023 I haven't had very many projects to showcase,
so this website also motivates me to keep updating the site with cool projects I will build.

*** Update ***
I have deployed the first version of my portfolio website on 6th Oct 2023!
I decided to use Github Pages to do this because of its easy integration 
with my project (the repo is already on GitHub). Of course, I intend to keep working ]
on it and making improvements. I am happy with it so far though:)
